# liri-node-app

I used node.js to create a app called Liri-bot. It has four functions. The first one is that is uses the spotify api to collect information on a song title the user enters. The second is it gives information on a music song using the spotify api. The third one give information on movie titles using the omdbi movie database. The fourth using a random.txt file to run any of the commands randomly.
